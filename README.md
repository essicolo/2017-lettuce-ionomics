Bacterial leaf spot (BLS) caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. vitians is one of the major constraint in lettuce production worldwide. The most sustainable strategy to control BLS identified to date is the use of resistant cultivars. The nutrient elemental signature (ionome) of ten lettuce cultivars with three levels of resistance was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) to assess which nutrient balance was linked to resistance to BLS, and to assess the effect of the infection with BLS on the ionome. The elemental concentrations were preprocessed with isometic log-ratios to define nutrient balances. From this approach, univariate nutrient balances [Fv | Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Mg, Ca, Na, K, S, N, P], [Mn | Zn, Cu], [Zn | Cu] and [S, N | P] were found to significantly affect the resistance of lettuce cultivars to BLS (p < 0.05). Moreover, infection of lettuce cultivars affects the lettuce ionome with the strongest effect observed on the [N, S | P] balance, where infection tended to lean his balance toward the N, S part relatively to P. This study shows that nutrient uptake in lettuce can be affected by BLS infection, and that the nutrient status affects the resistance to BLS infection.
